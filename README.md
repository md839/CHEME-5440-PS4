# CHEME-5440-PS4


This homework was collaborated between Apartim Jash, Eleanor Daugerdas, Michael Delaney, and Sonia Jaidka. 
All members contributed to the completed questions you see in this repository. 

The Jpg files (PS4 Page 1-4) are the hand written working out for question 1, showing the full solution working out. 
The excel (Cheme_5440_Pset4_Q1) file contains the raw numbers and graphs for 1b through 1d.


To get the plots for Questions 2 (b) and 2 (d), please run PS4_b_plot.m and PS4_d_plot.m, respectively. 
They will call the functions makeEqn.m or PS4_b.m or PS4_d.m to to set up the systems of equations solved for.
